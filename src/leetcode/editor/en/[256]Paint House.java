//There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. 
//
// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses. 
//
// Note: 
//All costs are positive integers. 
//
// Example: 
//
// 
//Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
//Output: 10
//Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
//Â             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
